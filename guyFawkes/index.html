This adventure based game is about the legendary Guy Fawkes and his trustful friend Robert Catesby, two men that decides to blow up the parliament with gunpowder, and thereby kill the king of England and all of his employees.
<br>
To be able to finish the game you need to choose to be either Guy Fawkes or Robert Catesby, where player 1 is Guy Fawkes, and Player 2 is Robert Catesby to kill the target, the King of England, with exploding gunpowder from a cellar beneath the parliament.
First you have to gather the team, by doing missions, get contacts, and get to know and trust eachother. Once you meet the second player, he can be able to join the game.
You will have to gather alot of powder, or gunpowder to be exact. You will either steal these barrels, or buy them in certain stores. They cost alot, but if you choose to steal them instead, there is only one place in England that have the right type of gunpowder.
You will have to find out by yourself which type of powder is the right one.
The correct type of gunpowder can be found in a shop, whether you steal or buy,  it is up to you as a player.
You collect money by robbing people or get them to somehow give you money. The choice is yours....
<br>
You need a specific level, or skill to unlock the missions. You get these experiences by doing challenges in the city. For example, you will need to practise before you can use a sword. Make contacts without making yourself suspicious, do <b>NOT</b> draw attention to yourself.
The more eyes you have on you, the difficulty level will increase. This is not an option. <b>It will happen</b>, sometime.

To finish the game, you have to fill up the basement beneath the parliament. Light the gunpowder, and run for your life so you don't get killed or caught. Do not draw attention to yourself either. They will be lookin for obvious signs.
